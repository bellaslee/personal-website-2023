## Process

I started with a mockup of my website using Figma. I knew that I wanted it to
have a pencil-sketched quality to it, as I've been especially into the work of
artist [@914.001](https://www.instagram.com/914.001/) on Instagram lately.

I spent an afternoon sketching out images of things I liked. I use a bee as my
logo because if you remove the middle of my name, that's what you get: (B)ella
L(ee)! Hahaha...

After I finished prototyping, I started to work on coding the components. I
must've spent at least 8 hours trying to figure out how to get my assets to
animate as I scrolled down the page, but I think it was worth it, and it's my
favorite part of my website. The next most difficult component to build was
probably the carousel. I spent a long time figuring out how to wrap the
elements, but decided to just forgo that in the end. I scrapped the feature, but
I still learned a lot from trying to figure it out.

In between creating each component and page, I brushed up on my React skills
with Stephen Grider's _Modern React With Redux_ course on Udemy. It was a lot of
conent to go through in 3 days, but I also learned a lot of skills that I
applied to this project immediately.

It took me about a week to get my website to a satisfactory state, but I did end
up continuously making small improvements to it.

My website used to look like this in 2020:

## Inspiration

### [Design by Roka](https://www.designbyroka.com/)

Shawn Park's website is the prettiest website I've ever seen. Though my skill
level is nowhere near his yet, his website really inspired me to create a
delightful user experience through animations and smooth transitions.

### [Bruno Givotovsky](https://www.brunog.design/)

I love the way that Bruno Givotovsky's organizes his project pages in his
portfolio website! Though my process is not as well documented as his, the way
this page is structed is _very_ loosely inspired by his work. Maybe some day it
will look as nice as his!

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- React.js + Sass
- How to create re-usable components
- More advanced and efficient DOM navigation
- How to factor out code redundancy on a larger scale
- What to consider when designing UX from scratch
- CSS animation
- Fun Javascript tricks I didn't get to learn in class.
