I coded this website the night before my first Makers Fair to use as a catalogue
for my shop. All components and stylesheets were coded from scratch. I displayed
it on my iPad so people could scan and view it on their own devices. I went for
a mobile-first design to ensure a smooth shopping experience.

This was my first time designing with an experience other than simple web
browsing in mind, so it was interesting considering how passing shoppers would
interact with my menu in this design space. While I was creating the website, I
anticipated that some people would want to scan the QR code to shop while they
walked if my table was crowded, but it turned out that most people preferred to
interact with the website directly on the iPad I had displayed. If I were to
redo this project, I would try to create a smoother image viewing experience.
