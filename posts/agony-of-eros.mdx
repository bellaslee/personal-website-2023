A lone rider overlooks the jutting  
seaside cliffs, wind sharply battering  
his face. In that moment he  
does not exist for the vast solitude  
stretches beyond time’s membrane.

He thinks he knows.  
He thinks he’s won  
when he’s blot out the stars  
when all he’s left  
is ashes and cinders.  
A veil descends like a phantom quietly  
weaving itself into the fabric of destiny.

Wake up. Do you see  
the sleeping masses?  
The dusky sky kisses  
the hill’s rolling grass  
as my tears turn  
into beads of glass  
and I shrink, shrink until all  
that remains is a spark, then  
no matter.
