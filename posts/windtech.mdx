## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability

We aim to develop a system with future growth in mind. Therefore, the system
must have a modular architecture and optimized performance and meet the
following requirements:

- **SCA-1**: The system shall be able to accommodate annual growth of 10% new
  drone fleets a year across different wind farm locations without
  user-perceptible performance degradation.
- **SCA-2**: The system shall scale to handle simultaneous maintenance on at
  least 50% of the wind turbines at any given location for at least 60 minutes.

### Availability

During working hours, maintenance technicians and other stakeholders must access
the system to schedule maintenance, deploy drones, and view real-time data to
make relevant decisions. Thus, the system must be highly available during
working hours, and at least available most of the time beyond working hours in
case of emergencies. The system does not have to be as strictly available
outside of working hours, as technicians are not actively scheduling and
analyzing maintenance. Since 100% availability would be unrealistic and put
unnecessary strain on WindTech’s budget, we instead strive for at least 99%
availability during critical hours to balance the request for “high
availability” and resource constraints. The system must be able to meet the
following availability requirements:

- **AVL-1**: The system must be at least 99% available on weekdays between 8
  a.m. and 5 p.m. GMT+1 on weekdays, and at least 95% available on weekdays
  between 5 p.m. and midnight GMT+1.
- **AVL-2**: Scheduled maintenance scheduled for Sundays between 8 p.m. and 3
  a.m. GMT+1 does not count toward the calculation of availability.
- **AVL-3**: WindTech shall inform employees one week before scheduled
  maintenance.
- **AVL-4**: A user shall not be able to access the system during maintenance
  and downtime, and shall instead be shown a message indicating when the system
  is expected to resume operation.

### Interoperability

The DFMS will be integrated with existing WindTech systems, thus we must ensure
compatibility and functionality across different platforms. Since employees must
sign into different systems depending on their tasks, single sign-on (SSO)
support is necessary for consistency and security (see "Security Needs"). The
DFMS must integrate with maintenance scheduling, weather forecasting, inventory
management, reporting, training, and more. Therefore, data exchange capabilities
and API compatibility are crucial.

- **IOP-1**: Requests made to APIs outside of the DFMS to other WindTech systems
  shall return results within 5 seconds 99% of the time.
- **IOP-2**: The DFMS API shall respond to external requests within 5 seconds
  99% of the time.
- **IOP-3**: The DFMS API shall throw specific error codes, messages, and
  appropriate responses.
- **IOP-4**: A user shall log into the DFMS using the same single sign-on login
  information to access WindTech system information.
- **IOP-5**: The system shall be able to export data in CSV and JSON formats.
- **IOP-6**: The DFMS API shall keep an audit trail of API transactions for up
  to one week.
- **IOP-7**: The DFMS API and related systems shall adhere to RESTful API
  standards (see "RESTful APIs").
- **IOP-8**: In the case of concurrent data updates, the DFMS shall check for
  inconsistencies and, if found, throw an error requesting the user to conduct
  manual verification.

### Sustainability

See "Environment and Noise Regulations" for more environmental sustainability
requirements; this section will focus on sustainable IT (SIT) practices.

Green IT practices are increasingly crucial, as cloud computing produces up to
3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, exceeding that of commercial flights
(Lavi, 2022). To ensure sustainability, the DFMS must meet the following
requirements:

- **SIT-1**: The system shall use a data center that can achieve a power usage
  efficiency (PUE) of 1.2 or less and is located in a region with abundant
  access to renewable energy (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, n.d.).
- **SIT-2**: The system shall prohibit consecutive transmissions of redundant
  data within 10 seconds to minimize network usage.
- **SIT-3**: Drones shall not be operated in inclement weather or harsh
  conditions, and shall be regularly maintained (see also SEC-8), to maximize
  their lifespan.

### Security

Data security is crucial for the DFMS to ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of operational data, prevent unauthorized access, protect
against cyber threats, comply with local and federal regulations, and enable
future capability expansions.

To secure data, the DFMS should adhere to the following requirements:

- **SEC-1**: Data transmission between drones, ground control stations, and
  services within the DFMS, such as scheduling and maintenance logs, shall be
  encrypted end-to-end.
- **SEC-2**: The system shall back up data daily at midnight.
- **SEC-3**: A user shall only be able to log into the DFMS if they have
  two-factor authentication.
- **SEC-4**: A user shall be able to log into the DFMS using WindTech SSO.
- **SEC-5**: Only users who have Maintenance Technician or Operation Manager
  permissions shall be able to operate the DFMS.
- **SEC-6**: Only users who have Maintenance Technician or Operation Manager
  permissions shall be able to unlock doors to drone storage areas using a
  security badge.
- **SEC-7**: The VP of Operations shall conduct compliance checks and audits
  once every three months.
- **SEC-8**: Operation Managers shall update drone firmware and software and
  conduct physical maintenance monthly to mitigate risks of malfunction.
- **SEC-9**: Drones shall be authenticated before being integrated into the
  DFMS.
- **SEC-10**: Drones shall not be able to fly further than the geographical
  boundaries of WindTech wind farms.
- **SEC-11**: Maintenance technicians shall conduct spectrum monitoring every 30
  minutes when drones are deployed.
- **SEC-12**: If external interference is detected, drone operations shall be
  paused until the source of interference is verified and removed.

Doing so will protect data and prevent unauthorized drone operations. In
addition to the above requirements, WindTech should:

- Use secure, cloud-based solutions, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or
  Microsoft Azure, for storing and analyzing sensitive data such as inspection
  reports, maintenance logs, and data collected during drone operations.
- Establish contingency plans in the case of drone malfunctions or external
  threats with the collaboration of the Chief Security Officer and VP of
  Operations.

## Standards and Compliance

### RESTful APIs

REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and following RESTful API
standards can help ensure system scalability, flexibility, and independence.
Compliant APIs adhere to the following principles:

- Uniform interface, where the server returns information in a standardized
  format
- Statelessness, where client requests are completed independently
- Layered system, where the API can work with several servers with multiple
  components
- Cacheability, where the client can store some server responses to improve
  response time
- Code on demand, where the software code can be temporarily transferred to the
  client (Amazon, n.d.).

### Accessibility Guidelines

To ensure the accessibility of materials relating to the DFMS project,
developers must address the following requirements:

- **USE-1**: All drone pilot training materials in audiovisual formats must have
  transcripts and closed captions.
- **USE-2**: The information hierarchy in human-machine or human-system
  interfaces must be programmatically determinable through proper formatting,
  tagging, and labeling such that they are navigable by screen-reader or other
  access technologies.
- **USE-3**: Crucial information, such as warnings and confirmation dialogues,
  shall be delivered with textual identification in addition to sensory
  characteristics, like size, color, and sound.
- **USE-4**: Text and images shall have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- **USE-5**: Text shall be able to be resized up to 200% without additional
  assistive technologies.

Since system warnings are crucial to upholding the safety of wind turbine
operations, warning messages and confirmation dialogues must be completely
accessible to individuals of all abilities. Additionally, computer interfaces
shall adhere to basic accessibility guidelines as dictated by the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 (Web Accessibility Initiative, 2023).

### Drone Regulations & Safety Requirements

Drones are considered unmanned aircraft systems. Because drones used for wind
turbine maintenance fly close to large structures and may require complex flight
patterns, they are classified under the “Specific” category. Operations in this
category are regulated by Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Regulation (EU)
2019/947 Annex A Part B. To comply with the requirements, we must ensure the
following:

- **SAF-1**: WindTech shall apply for operational authorization with the
  registration number of the drone operator, the name of the accountable manager
  or operator, an operational risk assessment, a list of measurable risk
  mitigation measures proposed by the operator, an operations manual, and a
  confirmation of appropriate insurance coverage.
- **SAF-2**: Drone pilots shall complete training before operating drones in
  areas such as situational awareness and error management; organizational
  safety culture, operational procedures, and organizational structure; stress
  management, fatigue, and vigilance; decision-making; automation and philosophy
  of the use of automation; specific UAS type-related differences; case-based
  studies; and drone piloting basic skills.
- **SAF-3**: WindTech shall keep records of drone pilots’ training courses and
  qualifications for at least three years after they cease employment.
- **SAF-4**: Interfaces for drone operations shall minimize the risk of pilot
  error by providing clear, intuitive, and distinguishable labeling and cause
  minimal fatigue.

The regulation outlines more guidelines that WindTech shall adhere to in its
operations, but the above constraints are most relevant to the scope of our DFMS
project (European Union Aviation Safety Agency, 2022, pp. 309–320).

### Environment and Noise Regulations

The EU defines 55 dB as the threshold for noise exposure, measured as an annual
average between day, evening, and night. However, noise levels above 40 dB are
known to harm wildlife. Regulations do not impose limit values but rather
dictate reporting thresholds. Governments must map noise levels, create action
plans, and designate quiet areas. Most established guidelines and regulations
focus on transport and industry sources, though some countries also have
specific regulations for wind turbines (European Environment Agency, 2020).

Though there are no formal regulations for drone noise levels, these guidelines
serve to help WindTech anticipate future policy developments and operate in good
faith to protect the environment.

To best adhere to these guidelines, the DFMS shall adhere to the following
constraints:

- **ENV-1**: Drones deployed for wind turbine inspections shall not fly through
  government-designated quiet areas.
- **ENV-2**: Drones operated by WindTech should not generate noise that exceeds
  55 dB at ground level, measured following the European Union Aviation Safety
  Agency’s (EASA) noise measurement guidelines.

#### EASA Noise Measurement Guidelines

Typically, drone manufacturers can measure drone noise levels according to EASA
guidelines and voluntarily provide the data. However, if the manufacturer does
not provide compliant noise ratings for its product, WindTech can refer to the
EASA’s Guidelines on Noise Measurement of Unmanned Aircraft Systems Lighter than
600 kg Operating in the Specific Category (Low and Medium Risk) for testing
conditions, including terrain, obstacles, temperature, humidity, precipitation,
windspeeds, and procedures (European Union Aviation Safety Agency, 2023).

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Besides employee data, the drone project may also inadvertently collect civilian
personal data, such as faces, house fronts, and vehicle registration plates
(DroneRules.eu, 2018). To comply with the EU’s GDPR, the DFMS project must
adhere to the following requirements:

- **SEC-13**: DFMS administrators shall maintain detailed documentation of
  collected data to present to regulatory authorities if necessary.
- **SEC-14**: Only users with Operation Manager and Safety Officer permissions
  shall have access to employee training histories.
- **SEC-15**: In addition to safety training, drone operators shall also
  complete data privacy training (Wolford, n.d.).
- **SEC-16**: Drone operators shall delete any footage that collects personal
  data irrelevant to wind turbine inspection, including, but not limited to,
  faces, house fronts, and vehicle registration plates.
