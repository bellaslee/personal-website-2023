## frameworks & languages used

React.js, CSS, Firebase, Node.js

## learning outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- Storing and retrieving data with Firebase
- Creating API requests in the useEffect hook
- How to handle state more efficiently
- Fetching data through the App component

In hindsight, I feel like we could have focused more on making the UX more
pleasing, but since this was a web development class, I give us a pass. It was
more important to me to learn Firebase and app structure than doing the UX
design.
