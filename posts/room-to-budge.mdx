## Frameworks & Languages Used

React.js, CSS, Firebase, Node.js

## Design Process

Since this project was created for a web development class, we did not focus
much on the design process. To view a more design-heavy project, check out my
writeup for [Itemize](https://www.bellalee.com/blog/posts/itemize).

Though our focus was not on design, but rather the implementation of our
intended functions, we still created
[Figma wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/8BGlRWDidakOIEQddLzsOH/Room-to-Budge?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=7T4xWA5SMI7RNOap-1)
for our project. We used the first week of the course to map out our information
architecture and establish a rough visual identity, then focused on learning
through collaboration to bring our product as close to our vision as we could
with the skills we acquired both in and out of class.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Store and retrieve data using Firebase
- Create API requests in the useEffect hook
- Handle state more efficiently
- Fetch data through the App component
