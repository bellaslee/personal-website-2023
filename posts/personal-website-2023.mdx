## Frameworks & Languages used

Next.js, GSAP, MDX, Sass, Node.js

## Process

### Learning GSAP

I coded my website from scratch last year to learn React, but I was quite new to
web development, so I didn't know animation frameworks existed. I ended up using
CSS animations and Javascript to figure out scroll-triggered animation. Earlier
this year, I emailed my favorite web design studio,
[Antinomy Studio](https://antinomy.studio/) to ask how they did their
animations. Their technical director, Baptiste, kindly got back to me and let me
know that they work with Nuxt.js and GSAP. I was surprised (and very touched)
that I got a reply, and promptly looked into their tools of trade. Since my
priority was designing cool animations, I decided to learn GSAP first, hence
this website rebuild.

I learned GSAP by making this atrocity!

Since I had experience with animation timelines and keyframes from fiddling with
CSS last year, the rest was pretty intuitive to pick up. I was so glad that GSAP
has pretty clear documentation and examples on their website.

It was challenging to figure out how to get animations to work with React's
useEffect hook. The solution provided in the docs did not work for me, so I had
to comb through the forums to mix and match other solution. That took me five
hours to figure out, but after I did, I found out that I didn't even need it yet
at that point... sigh... but I did end up using it later, so the effort was not
wasted!

I also added infinite scrolling on my blog using ScrollTrigger, which I'm pretty
pleased with.

### The Blog

I decided to create a blog so I could both document my process and have an
outlet for my urge to write comparative analyses for the media I consume. If I
don't end up writing any essays and posting them, at least I know how to build a
blog now!

I found that the features from the simple tutorial I followed weren't
sophisticated enough for my liking. I took a look at
[the Next.js blog starter template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/blog-starter-kit),
as well as
[this template](https://github.com/wutali/nextjs-netlify-blog-template) that I
found through a friend, and found the way they structured things much more
elegant. I found
[this tutorial](https://blog.nrwl.io/read-and-render-md-files-with-next-js-and-nx-89a85c1d9b44)
that showed me how to use frontmatter just the way I wanted to. However, the
issue is that I don't know Typescript yet (it's on my to-do list but who knows
when I'll get to it), so I had to figure out how to identify key elements and
replicate them with Javascript. I learned a lot about how Next.js works and how
to use API calls, getStaticProps, and getStaticPaths.

## Conclusion

I'd say my code is _way_ cleaner than
[last year's iteration](https://2022.bellalee.com), but I'm sure I can do even
better next time!

I can't help but compare my work to those amazing websites I see on
awwwards.com, but I have to remind myself that I'm just starting out, and I'll
get there eventually.
