The moment I landed in Taiwan to be home for the summer, I’ve been reading
non-stop, only putting my momentum on pause to work on personal projects (this
website, new merchandise designs for the fall Maker’s Fair, and a _Trigun_
fanzine) and internship applications. I’m currently reading _Fear and Trembling
and the Sickness Unto Death_ by Soren Kierkegaard, _On Earth We’re Briefly
Gorgeous_ by Ocean Vuong, _The Dao De Jing_ by Lao Zi, and a few product
management career development books. Without fail, I always end up reading
multiple books at once in a fixed rotation. I prefer reading this way because it
allows me to find connections between the texts and better remember their
contents. But instead of rambling about my current reads, here are my thoughts
on the books I’ve finished so far this summer!

**Disclaimer**: These are all my opinions — I believe stories impact each person
differently, and one is never more valuable or valid than another.

## This Is How You Lose the Time War

by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone

★★★★★

> Letters are structures, not events. Yours give me a place to live inside.
> (p. 95)

**Genre**: science fiction | **Setting**: history revisions carried out by
agents from two post-singularity civilizations | **Themes**: love against all
odds, time travel, and unconventional communication

### Synopsis

Two time-traveling agents from opposing factions communicate with each other
through unconventional letters woven into the fabric of history and space-time.
A story of love, intensity, hunger, surrender, and satiation.

### Thoughts

The prose in this novel is breathtaking, poetic, and intense. The story is
excruciatingly beautiful, and the expressions of love are raw and powerful. The
quote from one of the letters, “I want to be alone together,” reminds me of
Rilke’s quote, “Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest
human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can
grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it
possible for each to see the other whole against the sky,” as well as the
philosophy he describes in _Letters to a Young Poet_.

## The Night Circus

by Erin Morgenstern

★★★★★

> People see what they wish to see. And in most cases, what they are told that
> they see. (p. 33)

**Genre**: historical fantasy | **Setting**: a traveling circus from the 1880s
to the 1900s | **Themes**: fate and free will, fate, magic, and art

### Synopsis

_Le Cirque des Rêves_ shows up with no prior notice and opens only at night. The
masterminds behind this spectacle? Two illusionists with diametrically opposed
philosophies and an eccentric but oblivious theatrical producer with a penchant
for midnight parties. Each illusionist places his bet on a prodigious student
trained solely to win a duel of time, patience, and endurance in the extravagant
venue. The two opponents’ stories unfold with flourishes of magic and a
gradually intensifying romance.

### Thoughts

_The Night Circus_ has a writing style that left me enchanted with every word.
The experience of reading this book was like watching a well-choreographed,
one-of-a-kind performance. Morgenstern excels at visual imagery and creating a
mysterious, magical mood that made me feel like I was walking through the circus
myself. I also really enjoyed this quote on the power of storytelling, which
mirrors my perspective on the importance of literature and diverse narratives:
“There's magic in that. It's in the listener, and for each and every ear it will
be different, and it will affect them in ways they can never predict. From the
mundane to the profound. You may tell a tale that takes up residence in
someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move
them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of
your words” (p. 505).

I also really enjoyed reading this book because the paper for the copy that I
bought felt so good to touch, and the graphic design for the title pages was
absolutely delightful.

## Flowers of Buffoonery

by Osamu Dazai

★★★★★

> To them, laughing was safe, but not laughing posed a serious risk. They found
> it irresistible. One might say that they were gluttonous for laughter, unable
> to pass up even a stray crumb, out of fear they might be questioned for
> withholding.

**Genre**: historical fiction | **Setting**: a hospital ward in pre-war Japan |
**Themes**: personas, honesty, and human connection

### Synopsis

After a failed suicide attempt, Yozo’s friends and family visit him in a
hospital ward by the seaside, creating a lively atmosphere to lighten the
gravity of the situation. The novella is a more lighthearted take on the same
themes explored in Dazai’s _No Longer Human_, featuring the same protagonist.

### Thoughts

This novella convinced me that Osamu Dazai is the funniest writer I’ve read. He
inserts cheeky lines between scenes as the narrator, livening up the story and
making it absurd, funny, and thought-provoking at the same time. The translator
also did his humor a lot of justice with the word choices. One of my favorite
lines has to be, “Once a writer loses his affection for his subject, his
sentences display a marked decline in quality. Actually, I take it back. That
last one there was snazzy.” The juxtaposition between the dark situation and the
witty narration makes _Flowers of Buffoonery_ memorable and endearing.

## Lie With Me

by Philippe Besson

★★★★☆

> In later years, I will often write about the unthinkable, the element of
> unpredictability that determines outcomes. And game-changing encounters, the
> unexpected juxtapositions that can shift the course of a life.

**Genre**: historical fiction | **Setting**: 1984 France | **Themes**: identity,
homophobia, and missed opportunities

### Synopsis

A novel writer remembers his first love when he meets a young man with a
strikingly similar appearance to his former lover and creative muse. _Lie With
Me_ is a tragic reminiscence of a past love that can never be relived.

### Thoughts

The two-part delivery and the atmosphere reminds me of Natsume Soseki’s
_Kokoro_. The pain from the stigma and shame surrounding homosexuality at the
time paired with the feelings of yearning and abandonment beautifully illustrate
the barriers that society and timing can create, but also that lost
relationships aren’t at all meaningless.

## All About Love: New Visions

by bell hooks

★★★☆☆

> And they know that what we think love means is not always what they believe it
> means. Our confusion about what we mean when we use the word “love” is the
> source of our difficulty in loving.

**Genre**: creative nonfiction

### Synopsis

"This book tells us how to return to love" in a way that is free from
patriarchal constraints and the matrix of oppression and ignorance created by
modern society. It expands love's definition beyond the notion of romance and
emotional attachment — it empowers by providing the language needed to
differentiate between love and other, often conditioned, feelings.

### Thoughts

Though the ideas presented are powerful, their impact is (in my opinion)
diminished through the assertive tone and excessive repetition. The writing
leaves no room for reflection or reader interpretation. Instead, hooks seems to
be trying to push her ideas onto the reader rather than allowing the reader to
slowly digest her worldview as food for thought. Even so, I'd still strongly
recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their relationships with
others, as it helped me change my mindset to be more compassionate and
understanding towards someone I could not see eye to eye with before.
Approaching the book with an open mind and powering through the sometimes
tiresome tone is worth it.

I liked that hooks uses quotes from various writers and philosophers — including
Erich Fromm, Thích Nhất Hạnh, Carl Jung, and Ranier Maria Rilke — to support her
arguments. She takes these ideas and synthesizes them into an overview of what
it means to love in today’s society. The message of her book reminds me of Leo
Tolsky’s “We are asleep until we fall in love.”

## The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo

by Taylor Jenkins Reid

★★★★☆

> I’d told him I was someone else. And then I started getting angry that he
> couldn’t see who I really was.

**Genre**: historical fiction | **Setting**: late 20th-century Hollywood |
**Themes**: identity, found family, misogyny, sexuality, and power dynamics

### Synopsis

Reclusive superstar Evelyn Hugo, who rose to fame in the 1960s, tells the
secrets behind her seven husbands to the world and reveals who was the true love
of her life.

### Thoughts

Tragic love stories are typically my cup of tea, but this one left me feeling
gloomy after I finished it. However, Reid is a master at creating suspense that
keeps you turning the pages one after another until you reach the end before you
even know it. Evelyn Hugo is a flawed protagonist that matures as the narrative
progresses, and her life is full of drama, manipulation, and love affairs that
are entertaining but become somewhat predictable.

## Carmilla

by Joseph Sheridan le Fanu

★★★☆☆

> Over the sward and low grounds a thin film of mist was stealing like smoke,
> marking the distances with a transparent veil; and here and there we could see
> the river faintly flashing in the moonlight.

**Genre**: gothic horror | **Setting**: a castle in late 19th-century Austria |
**Themes**: obsession and charisma

### Synopsis

Deep in a gloomy Austrian forest, Laura lives an isolated life, sharing a castle
with only her father and two household staff. Just as she begins to long for a
companion, Carmilla appears in her life. Her companion is languid and eerily
beautiful, only appearing in their company in the afternoon. When Laura falls
ill, her father's ongoing investigations reveal that her companion is not who
she claims to be.

### Thoughts

_Carmilla_ is structured like your typical gothic horror novella, beginning with
a recollection of events through documents and letters (similar to _The Phantom
of the Opera_ and _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_). It has an
intriguing premise, a romantic but eerie atmosphere, and charming characters,
but the latter third of the book is anticlimactic and predictable. I still
really enjoy the gothic writing style though, as writers of the era seem to
excel at creating tense moods, as demonstrated by the chosen excerpt.

## Sea of Tranquility

by Emily St. John Mandel

★★★☆☆

> My personal belief is that we turn to postapocalyptic fiction not because
> we’re drawn to disaster, per se, but because we’re drawn to what we imagine
> might come next. We long secretly for a world with less technology. (p. 191)

**Genre**: science and speculative fiction | **Setting**: 1912 Canada, 2020 USA,
and 2203 and 2401 moon colonies | **Themes**: pandemics, fate, hindsight, and
the meaning of life

### Synopsis

A post-apocalyptic time travel novel that explores the purpose of existence and
the nature of reality.

### Thoughts

The sci-fi tropes used in the novel were cliché and the writing style was bland
compared to the other reads. Mandel’s writing didn’t have an emotional impact on
me until the end, and by then, it was too late to get me invested in the
characters. She focuses more on developing a speculative world rather than
character development. Though the concept was interesting, I would have enjoyed
it more if the scenes were more descriptive and immersive.
