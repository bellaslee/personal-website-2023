## Inspiration

Burnout is a prevalent issue in today‚Äôs fast-paced society, as highlighted by
Byung-Chul Han in his book The Burnout Society. Burnout is not a medical
diagnosis. Rather, it is characterized by intense emotional exhaustion. This is
caused by the productivity-focused, auto-exploitative society, as well as the
information overload that comes with social media. Space today seems to be less
‚Äúgrounded‚Äù and more ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù. To combat this, we hope to provide uninterrupted
time through Umwelt to help people recenter and revitalize. We provide small
milestones for people to accomplish in a gamified manner. We chose walking
through nature as an activity due to its accessibility and effectiveness,
though, if we had more time, we would like to consider the design question of
‚Äúhow can we accommodate those who are not able-bodied or do not have safe
communities to walk in?‚Äù Though we recognize that this is a systematic issue, we
hope to make incremental changes through micro-interventions like Umwelt.

## What it does

Block out distractions with Umwelt and enjoy a hero‚Äôs journey through nature.
During your walk, you will unlock various encounters in your surroundings. Look
out for and capture these moments and absorb the beauty of the spaces around
you.

Burnout is the opposite of vitality ‚Äî it is utter exhaustion. Through Umwelt, we
hope to reshape individual perceptions of experiences and reality to revitalize
daily life. In doing so, we hope to drive transformation in modern productivity
culture and curb the development of a burnout society.

## Mission

To revitalize society by finding little moments of magic in nature

## Vision

Encouraging sustainable and balanced lifestyles It can be difficult to swim
against the currents of social media in an age of constant information overload.
With Umwelt, we can embark on an adventure of mindset transformation to move
towards a balanced life.

## Transforming experiences to enhance our collective vitality

Let‚Äôs take a moment to reshape our interactions with the spaces we inhabit to
nourish our physical, mental, and spiritual vitality.

## Becoming able to simply exist

What does it mean to live a ‚Äúgood‚Äù life? Taking a walk in nature is
‚Äúunproductive‚Äù by societal standards, which is precisely why we should do it: to
relish in the art of lingering and of simply being.

## How we built it

Our team collaborated on the low-fidelity design process, then began to branch
off into high-fidelity design (Annie and Stephanie), research and web
development (Bella), and iOS development (Sean). Annie and Stephanie worked with
Figma and Adobe Illustrator; Bella worked with Next.js, GSAP, SASS, and
Bootstrap; and Sean worked with Swift. We maintained open communication and
discussion throughout the process to ensure we stayed on the right track and
adhered to our initial visions.

## Challenges we ran into

As a team, our main challenge was brainstorming ways to use technology to
encourage independence from it. For Sean, it was challenging to learn how to use
iOS frameworks for the camera and map under time constraints. For Annie and
Stephanie, the linear user flow was challenging due to being different from what
you‚Äôd expect from a typical app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is our first in-person hackathon experience, so we are proud of coming this
far under immense time pressure. Our ideation process was highly enjoyable, and
we are proud of stepping out of our comfort zones to design an experience rather
than a tool. We also figured out our strengths quickly and adapted to fit them
into the creation process.

## What we learned

So much‚Ä¶ The design team learned how to animate boxes, Sean learned iOS
animation and frameworks, Bella learned new front-end animation and interaction
techniques, and we all learned how to collaborate within a cross-functional
team.

## What's next for Umwelt

We hope to expand Umwelt further as a personal project. After developing an MVP,
we would like to have people test it and start gathering user feedback.

## Development report

### 1. brainstorming

We kicked off our hackathon session by first identifying the track, and then the
related problem spaces that we were interested in. We decided to approach
vitality from four perspectives: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. We
realized, however, that many of these areas overlap, and that vitality extends
to all areas of life. Our favorite ideas were burnout society, time in nature,
and sustainable knowledge, so we discussed these areas more in-depth, then
proceeded to research and design.

### 2. problem space

Burnout is a prevalent issue in today‚Äôs fast-paced society, as highlighted by
Byung-Chul Han in his book _The Burnout Society_. Burnout is not a medical
diagnosis. Rather, it is characterized by intense emotional exhaustion. This is
caused by the productivity-focused, auto-exploitative society, as well as the
information overload that comes with social media. Space today seems to be less
‚Äúgrounded‚Äù and more ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù. To combat this, we hope to provide uninterrupted
time through _Umwelt_ to help people recenter and revitalize. We provide small
milestones for people to accomplish in a gamified manner, as maps and
gamification are proven to be effective design choices to incentivize activity.
We chose walking through nature as an activity due to its accessibility and
effectiveness, though, if we had more time, we would like to consider the design
question of ‚Äúhow can we accommodate those who are not able-bodied or do not have
safe communities to walk in?‚Äù Though we recognize that this is a systematic
issue, we hope to make incremental changes through micro-interventions like
_Umwelt_.

### 3. process

#### 3.1 design

[View our Figma wireframes here](https://www.figma.com/file/9X5AabfVYMBYkwerbrBOYy/DubHacks-23'?type=design&node-id=32%3A1400&mode=design&t=Ziw28LGMl86lQXhO-1)

We were inspired by Taiwan Design Expo and other minimalistic, whimsical designs
for our branding.

#### 3.2 iOS development

We worked on design and development simultaneously to cover more ground as a
team.

- Space seems less ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù and more ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù
- "Slow living is not a counter-cultural movement: it does not propose the

  currently inhabit." (62)
  - ‚Üí üí°We aim to reshape our interactions with the spaces in our communities to
    promote sustainable practices of physical, mental, and spiritual vitality.
  - Community spaces in daily life are often taken for granted
- "At the heart of slow living is a certain 'mindful' consciousness where
  activities, practices, and encounters are invested with care and attention and
  such a consciousness requires particular spatial contexts as much as it
  requires a slow temporality." (63)
