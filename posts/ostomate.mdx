## Process

I created the logo and assets for my research lab team's marketing materials and
presented them at the Dempsey Startup Competition. To create the logo, I started
off with a few thumbnails.

I decided to go with the version on the bottom left. However, as I was
designing, I soon realized that the composition of the logo looked off. It was
hard to make it readable at a smaller size, and the visual language did not look
friendly enough. After ideating with a friend, the image on the right became the
final logo.

After finalizing the logo design, I moved on to creating illustrations that
would be used for stickers, a poster, and a flyer. Here is the end result:

I tried my best to illustrate in a style that would be attractive to viewers but
still highlight the importance of the issue we are solving. The main goal of the
graphics for this project was to attract and retain the attention of as many
judges as possible.

## Outcome

Osto-Mate was able to advance to the Sweet Sixteen Semi-Final Round for the
competition. I helped finalize the design for the pitch deck and, after hours of
discussion and memorization, we finally pitched to a panel of seven judges on
May 26th, 2022. Unfortunately, we did not make it to the top four, but we did
win the $2,500 Karr Tuttle Campbell Best Health and Wellness Impact Idea Prize.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- How to create graphics with a target audience in mind (in this case, the
  judges that would be giving us investment dollars)
- Logo design in Adobe Illustrator
- Layouts where there is the same amount of text as (or more text than) images.
  I had previously only worked with designs with minimal text
- Public speaking and presentation-making

I hope to have the chance to work with more information-focused design in the
future, too, as this was a really interesting challenge for me to tackle!
