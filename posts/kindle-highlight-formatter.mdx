I'm a hardcore [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) user and have been using the
[Kindle sync plugin](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin) to import
my highlights since August. However, my 12-year-old, first-generation Kindle
started crashing my whole computer whenever I accessed its files, so I had to
find other ways to import them. The plugin supports importing from your online
Kindle library, but I get my ebooks from external sources, so, unfortunately,
this method doesn't work for me. I like the way the plugin formats the
highlights, so I made this tool to help me do that quickly using notebooks
exported from the app instead of manually finding and replacing every time.
Before I made this, I had been using the
[highlighted app](https://highlighted.app/) for its OCR (I highly recommend it,
it's great for digitizing excerpts from print books, for personal use only, of
course).

This is just a silly little thing I made on a whim to make my life and
notetaking process easier, but if it can help someone else too, that would be
super neat! If you do end up using it, feel free to let me know. My contact info
can be found at the bottom of this page.

And, just for fun, here's what the graph view of my Obsidian vault looks like
now:
