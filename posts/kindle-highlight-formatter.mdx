## the tool

I'm a hardcore [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) user and have been using the
[Kindle sync plugin](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin) to import
my highlights since August. However, my 12-year-old, first-generation Kindle
started crashing my whole computer whenever I accessed its files, so I had to
find other ways to import them. The plugin supports importing from your online
Kindle library, but I get my ebooks from external sources, so, unfortunately,
this method doesn't work for me. I like the way the plugin formats the
highlights, so I made this tool to help me do that quickly using notebooks
exported from the app instead of manually finding and replacing every time.
Before I made this, I had been using the
[highlighted app](https://highlighted.app/) for its OCR (I highly recommend it,
it's great for digitizing excerpts from print books, for personal use only, of
course).

This is just a silly little thing I made on a whim to make my life and
note-taking process easier, but if it can help someone else too, that would be
super neat! If you do end up using it, feel free to let me know. My contact info
can be found at the bottom of this page.

Although a [Kindle formatter](https://kindle-formatter.com/) already exists, I
found its customization features somewhat challenging to navigate. I decided to
build my own since it would double as good
[coding practice](https://github.com/bellaslee/personal-website-2023/blob/main/src/pages/kindle-highlight-formatter.js).
While writing this, I realized that it allows the user to upload a file, so I
might try to integrate that in the future. But for now, what I made works super
well for me!

## a bit on my note-taking process

![Demo of note system](/img/posts/kindle-highlight-formatter/1.gif)

No matter if I'm reading an ebook or print book, I always take notes in a
[Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) notebook. I have multiple lying
around my house and in my bag so I'm never caught without a place to jot down my
ideas. I started this habit when I was reading _The Count of Monte Cristo_ since
I didn't want to ruin the 1946 library copy with sticky notes (I really thought
it was going to disintegrate in my hands at one point). Now, I have a shoebox
full of finished notebooks that are my pride and joy.

After reading the book, I digitize my notes and thoughts. I've been trying to
process my thoughts on by writing mini
[essays](https://www.bellalee.com/blog/tags/essay) so I don't forget what I read
(at the time of writing this post, I haven't refined any enough to a point where
I'd be satisfied with others seeing them; this is a new habit). By doing so, I
hope to move from an attitude of mindless consumption that's encouraged by
social media today to a thoughtful, lifelong learner approach. Through writing,
I slow down my thoughts and distill them into something clear, memorable, and
applicable to my life.

In my writing process, I import Kindle highlights (or highlights from physical
books) into the bottom of my document. I usually split my notes into four
sections: notes, thoughts, questions, and highlights. After reading, I compose a
short summarizing essay that addresses my questions using evidence from my notes
and highlights, then wrap up with broader implications and connections from my
thoughts section.

Anyways, this gives some context for my rationale behind making this tool. I
just started reading
_[The Eternal Drama: The Inner Meaning of Greek Mythology](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/589743)_
by [Edward F. Edinger](https://www.jungstudycenter.org/Edward-F-Edinger) and
wasn't in the mood to force restart my computer trying to extract files from my
Kindle ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶
